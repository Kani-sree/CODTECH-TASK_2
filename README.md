Project Overview
This project involves predicting a student's GPA based on their weekly study time. You are using a linear regression model to make predictions and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). Additionally, you are visualizing the results to understand the relationship between study time and GPA.

Project Name
"Prediction of GPA based on Weekly Study Time"

Objective
The objective of the project is to build a predictive model that estimates a student's GPA based on the amount of time they spend studying each week. The model's effectiveness is evaluated through MSE and R-squared metrics, with visualizations to illustrate the relationship between study time and GPA.

Key Activities
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset.
Feature Selection: Select the study time as the predictor variable and GPA as the target variable.
Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Use the testing set to evaluate model performance using MSE and R².
Visualization:
Plot the regression line on training data.
Compare actual vs predicted values for testing data.
Technologies Used
Python for implementation.
Pandas for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
Matplotlib for data visualization.![Screenshot 2024-12-30 211842](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47889f4d-f7b8-4f42-a788-551732d0b1a3)
